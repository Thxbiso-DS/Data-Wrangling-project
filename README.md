# Data Wrangling (247)
## Project Overview

* Objective: Demonstrate the ability to merge and filter dataframes as well as the ability to manipulate rows and columns through the use of functions and pre-installed attributes
* Data files: [personality scores](http://syllabus.africacode.net/projects/data-science-specific/data-wrangling/personality_scores.csv) and [department data](http://syllabus.africacode.net/projects/data-science-specific/data-wrangling/departments.csv)
* Project instructions: [here](http://syllabus.africacode.net/projects/data-science-specific/data-wrangling/)
 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/Thxbiso-DS/Data-Wrangling-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ``` 
    cd Data-Wrangling-project/    
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment with a name of your choice:
   ```
   python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
   ```

4. Activate your environment:
   - On Windows:
    ```powershell 
    .\<virtual-environment-name>\Scripts\activate
    ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source  <virtual-environment-name>/bin/activate
    ```

5. Install Jupyter in your virtual environment:
    ```
    pip install jupyter notebook
    ```

6. Install dependencies to your virtual environment:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``````

7. Start jupyter notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

8. Navigate to http://localhost:8888 in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`data_wrangling_panda_project.ipynb`).

2. Navigate to kernels and choose the kernel corresponding to your virtual environment.  

3. Run the cells in sequential order to execute the program.
